## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nishesh, a 4th Year Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

I am currently looking for a co-op internship (_Sept-Dec 2023_) in Data Engineering, MLOps, DevOps, or Software Development.

I have always been interested in solving problems and getting this running smoothly. I bring this energy to my work and always strive to deliver the best of what I can.

I have been working mainly in Python lately, but have experience with Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and R.

### Home-Lab

Over the past 5 years, I have been tinkering away on my home-lab to try out new technologies and learn how things fit together. 
This journey began as a way to be able to get access to the same video library I had access to on my Hard Drive and on Netflix at home while I was at university in another country. 

I started out by repurposing my old desktop computer that I had to leave behind when I set out for university. 
On it, I set up Plex and an OpenVPN server on OpenMediaVault 5 to solve my main problems and provide a simple web-based UI to manage the entire system.
This has evolved into a cluster with the same old server, and 2 Dell Optiplex Micro PCs that run Proxmox with High Availability for all VMs and applications running on them.
